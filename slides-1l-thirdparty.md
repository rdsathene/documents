## Third-Party Beneficiaries

When a promisor and a promisee make an contractual agreement that the promisor will tender their performance (a benefit) to a party other than the promisee, we have a third party beneficiary situation.

Third Party

## After Contracting

Promisor: owes a duty of performance to the third party

Promisee: is owed the performance to the third party

Third Party: not in privity to contract, but owed performance by promisor

---

## Overall Analysis

Approach problems by asking the following:

- <span>Is the third party an intended beneficiary?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --></span>
- <span>Can the promisor and promisee change contract terms without the third party's consent?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" --></span>
    - <span>Alternatively, ask have the third party's rights vested?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" --></span>
- <span>What are the rights of the parties?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" --></span>

## Can the Third Party Beneficiary Sue?

- an intended third party beneficiary can sue
- an incidental third party beneficiary has **no** contractual rights

The latter may benefit, but it is **not** the primary purpose of contract to benefit them

---

## Intended Beneficiary?

Frequently the language of the contract will indicate if the promisee intended to confer a right of performance to the third party.

If it is not clear in the language of the contract, then the court will look at several factors to determine intent.

---

## Factors to Determine Intent

- Is the third party expressly designated in the contract?
- Is performance to be made directly to the third party?
- Does the third party have any rights defined in the contract?
- Does the third party have a relationship with the promisee that would create an inference of intent to benefit?

---

## Which Type of Intended Beneficiary?

Ask what the promisee's purpose was in inducing the promisor's performance to the third party.

- **Creditor Beneficiary**: the promisee owed the third party an obligation
- **Donee Beneficiary**: the promisee wanted to confer a gift on third party

---

## Can the Contracting Parties Make Changes?

The promisor and promisee are free to modify, rescind, or discharge the contract as they see fit until the intended beneficiary's rights have vested.

---

## Vesting of Rights

An intended beneficiary's rights vest when they…

- <span>justifiably rely to their detriment on the promise (change of position)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --></span>
- <span>bring a suit to enforce the promise<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" --></span>
- <span>manifest assent to the promise at the request of either party<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" --></span>

## Party Rights and Defenses

*Third-Party Beneficiary v. Promisor*

- the beneficiary may sue the promisor for failure to perform
- promisor's defenses
	- any defenses that promisor had against promisee
	- if the promise is not absolute, then promisor can assert the defenses the promisee would have against the beneficiary

---

## Party Rights and Defenses

*Third-Party Beneficiary v. Promisee*

- **Donee Beneficiary:** generally **no** right to sue promisee
    - exception where there's been detrimental reliance (change of position)
        - in that case they are suing under promissory estoppel/detrimental reliance, not as a third-party beneficiary

---

## Party Rights and Defenses

*Third-Party Beneficiary v. Promisee*

- **Creditor Beneficiary:** can sue for the value of the *pre-existing* debt or obligation

---

## Party Rights and Defenses

*Promisee v. Promisor*

- promisee may sue for promisor's failure to tender performance to third-party beneficiary
    - promisee and third-party beneficiary cannot both recover from promisor
    - courts will sometimes order ***specific performance*** in circumstance where the promisor was to pay for an unpaid debt
