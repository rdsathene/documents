## Third Party Beneficiaries

When a promisor and a promisee make an contractual agreement that the promisor will tender their performance (a benefit) to a party other than the promisee, we have a third party beneficiary situation.

Third Party

## After Contracting

Promisor: owes a duty of performance to the third party

Promisee: is owed the performance to the third party

Third Party: not in privity to contract, but owed performance by promisor

---

## Overall Analysis

Approach problems by asking the following:

- <span>Is the third party an intended beneficiary?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --></span>
- <span>Can the promisor and promisee change contract terms without the third party's consent?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" --></span>
    - <span>Alternatively, ask have the third party's rights vested?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" --></span>
- <span>What are the rights of the parties?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" --></span>

---

## Can the Third Party Beneficiary Sue?

- an intended third party beneficiary can sue
- an incidental third party beneficiary has not contractual rights

The latter may benefit, but it is **not** the primary purpose of contract

---

## Intended Beneficiary?

Generally the language of the contract will 

- assignor dies or goes bankrupt
- assignor makes a subsequent assignment (to another assignee)
- assignor notifies obligor or assignee of revocation
- assignor takes direct performance from obligor

---

## Irrevocable

The following are irrevocable assignments:

- assignments for value
    - for consideration
    - as security for or as payment for preexisting debt

----

## Irrevocable

The following are also irrevocable assignments:

- detrimental reliance on a gratuitous assignment
    - foreseeable reliance; **and** actual reliance (change of position)
- performance or payment tendered by obligor
- special evidence of the assignment (token chose or writing of same)

---

## Party Rights and Liabilities

*Assignee v. Obligor*

- recover from the obligor directly
- obligor has same defenses as against assignor (assignee steps into shoes)
- payment by obligor to assignor prior to notice exempted

----

## Party Rights and Liabilities

*Assignor v. Obligor*

- assignor has no rights in the contract after an effective assignment

----

## Party Rights and Liabilities

*Assignee v. Assignor*

- gratuitous assignment, no recovery
- assignment for value subject to **implied warranties of assignment**, if breached allow recover for damages
	- right assigned exists
	- right assigned not subject to defenses
	- assignor will not impair of defeat value of the right

---

## Multiple Successive Assignments

**gratuitous:** last assignment prevails, unless a previous assignment was made [irrevocable](#/8/1)

**value:** first assignee for consideration prevails, unless a later, good faith assignee obtains payment or judgement first, obtains a novation with obligor, or obtains evidence of ownership (e.g. a deed or other document)

## Delegation

A delegation is a present transfer of duties under a contract.

#### **General Rule:** all contracts are delegable.

Exceptions:

- <span>duties involving personal judgment, skill, or special trust<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --></span>
- <span>materially changes obligee's expectancy of performance<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" --></span>
- <span>contract expressly prohibits delegation or assignment<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" --></span>

---

## Requirements

- an existing valid contract
- a promisor (delegator) making present words of intent to delegate
    - no writing required

---

## Party Rights and Liabilities

*Obligee*

- must accept duties from delagatee, unless those duties were nondelegable

----

## Party Rights and Liabilities

*Delagator*

- remains liable for duties under contract, but is secondarily liable 

----

## Party Rights and Liabilities

*Delagatee*

Was there a delegation, or a delegation plus an assumption of the duty?

- delegation creates power for another to perform for delegator
- assumption occurs when delagatee's promise is supported by consideration (third party)

----

## Novation?

See previous discussion on [novation](#/4/4) under assignment.

However, if an obligee expressly consents to the transfer of duties, it may be construed as a novation.

---

## No Assignment Clauses

- <span>clause prohibiting assignment of "the contract" generally construed to bar delegation <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --></span>
- <span>clause prohibiting assignment of rights provide obligor ground for suit, but assignment is still valid (power v. right) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" --></span>
- <span>clause stating attempts to assign with be **VOID** render void (power v. right) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" --></span>
