# 1L Contracts 2019

> “…he laughed at him for imagining the dishonesty and covetousness of his countrymen could be restrained by written laws, which were like spiders’ webs, and would catch, it is true, the weak and poor, but easily be broken by the mighty and rich” — [Plutarch](https://http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/solon.html) *Solon*
