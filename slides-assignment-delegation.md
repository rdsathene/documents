## Assignment and Delegation

In contrast to third party rights, which are defined in the contract, assignments and delegations occur after a contract is formed.

---

## A party…

Assigns rights — *performance owed*

Delegates duties — *performance due*

---

## Assignment

An assignment is a transfer of a right under a contract.

### Novation?

This is different than a novation in that novation requires agreement by all parties 

(*see* full rule *barbi* VI.E.8).

Here, the obligor is not part of the agreement to transfer rights from assignor to assignee.

---

#### **General Rule:** all contracts are assignable.

Exceptions:

- <span>substantially change obligor's duty, increase their risk, or reduce contract value<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --></span>
- <span>doesn't disproportionally alter quantities in output or requirements contracts<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" --></span>
- <span>contract expressly prohibits assignment<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" --></span>
