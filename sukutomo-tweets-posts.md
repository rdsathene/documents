Starting in Novemember 2016, I became on one of the primary contributors for Sukutomo's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/schoolidolu) account and [news account](https://schoolido.lu/activities/5464949/). I compose most tweets and posts on the hackmd.io site, although I do use BBedit on the Mac and ReText to edit markdown too. I wanted to start compiling my model templates here for others to use, and for more own reuse (although I typically use the hackmd.io for the latter purpose). My goal is to also create a series for the song release tweets, TBT event tweets, etc. so that we don't have to regenerate those every year.
