Starting in Novemember 2016, I became on one of the primary contributors for Sukutomo's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/schoolidolu) account and [news account](https://schoolido.lu/activities/5464949/). I compose most tweets and posts on the hackmd.io site, although I do use BBedit on the Mac and ReText on Linux to edit markdown too. I wanted to start compiling my model templates here for others to use, and for more own reuse (although I typically use the hackmd.io for the latter purpose). This will eventually be added the wiki for public consumption, and perhaps be incorportate into Sukutomo's repository. My goal is to also create a series for the song release tweets, TBT event tweets, etc. so that we don't have to regenerate those every year.
