# Syllabi Boilerplate

### **Grading**

Good Academic standing is determined by maintenance of an average grade of C or higher, with no Fs, and no more than one D for first year students. (This means the average of final grades in each class each quarter). The following grading system is used:

### **Grading Scale**

| Grading | Scale       |
| ------- |:----------- |
| 97–100  | A+          |
| 93–96   | A           |
| 90–92   | A-          |
| 87–89   | B+          |
| 83–86   | B           |
| 80–82   | B-          |
| 77–79   | C+          |
| 73–76   | C           |
| 70–72   | C-          |
| 67–69   | D+          |
| 63–66   | D           |
| 60–62   | D-          |
| 0–59    | F - failing |

Students will receive a numerical grade at the completion of each quarter.

### **Grade Determination**

The syllabus must provide each student with a written statement explaining the extent to which each of the following will be used in determining a final grade:

(1) The final examination;

(2) Intermediate, mid-year, or other examinations;

(3) Class performance, including preparation and participation, whether in a classroom, through correspondence, or online, which must not be more than 3% of the grade.

(4) Evaluation of examinations or other performance by persons other than the instructor; and

(5) Any other consideration that might affect the grade in any course.

### **Plagiarism**

All PCL students are expected to know about and avoid plagiarism and other forms of cheating. All exam answers and assignments must be done solely by the student. Plagiarism and other forms of cheating are subject to discipline under PCL’s Disciplinary Code. The Code can be found in the Student Handbook and normally on the PCL website. If an Instructor has a reasonable belief that the work was not done solely by the student, or that the student engaged in plagiarism or other cheating, the Instructor must report the belief to the Dean or the Administrator.

### **Attendance**

State Bar Guideline 5.3(A)(1) “requires regular and punctual attendance of not less than eighty (80) percent of the regularly scheduled class hours in each course.” For a course that extends over more than one quarter, for example, two quarters, this Guideline means that the student must attend 80% of the regularly scheduled class hours in each quarter of the course (The Guideline does not mean that the student must attend 80% of the total combined regularly scheduled class time of the two quarters).

### **Accommodations**

Students needing information about accommodations for disabilities should read pages 38-40 of the *Student Handbook*.
