# Attorney Referrals ([*](https://rds-pcl-outlines.tumblr.com/post/185715992461/attorney-referrals))

Now that I'm licensed, I get even more people asking for referals. I'm going to keep adding to this list, so that I can refer people to it, and use it myself. These are all people that I know, many of them were my law school instructors, fellow students, or fellow faculty members. Under that is a list of Los Angeles legal organizations for people with limited resources.
